<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email`, `email_client`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Built With

* Python: Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Scipy, Tensorflow, Keras, LightGBM, Optuna, SHAP, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* R: Tidyverse, ggplot2 and rlang

## Prerequisites

In order to work with the same data I did, you will need to apply to become an accredited researcher with the ONS (Office for National Statistics). Then you'll need to submit a project application to work with the [GRADE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/grading-and-admissions-data-for-england-grade-framework) dataset. This is a lengthy and involved process, best to allow ~6 months before you'd be able to get started working with the data.

If you do gain access to the dataset, you will also need to request a custom virtual environment to be created for you within the Secure Research Service. Then you'll also need to request whatever non-standard packages you want to be installed there, as you are not able to ingest code or install packages yourself. I requested Keras, Tensorflow, LightGBM, Optuna and Shap to be installed.
